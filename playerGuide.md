# Player Guide

## Controls
Player 1: 
- W = Jump
- S = Crouch
- A = Left
- D = Right
- F = Light Attack
- G = Heavy Attack
- H = Dust Attack

Player 2: 
- I = Jump
- K = Crouch
- J = Left
- L = Right
- [ = Light Attack
- ] = Heavy Attack
- \ = Dust Attack

```Tip: When on the ground, you automatically face your opponent.```

## Basics
### Movement
- You have a double jump
### Offense
- Notation: Most of the inputs in this guide will follow numpad notation:

  7 8 9
  
  4 5 6
  
  1 2 3
  
- So for example,
    - 5H is just pressing heavy attack, but 2H is pressing it while crouching.
    - Additionally, j.H stands for jumping heavy attack, for example.
    - 236L would have you start at down, then down-forwards, then forwards, then hit light attack.
```Tip:Commands are inputted in the facing direction. For instance, 6L would be inputted with right+light if your opponent was on the right and left+light if they were on the left.```
- Characters have light attacks, heavy attacks, and dust attacks. These give different moves depending on whether or not you are crouching or jumping.
- Gatling Combos: Attacks of various strengths can chain into each other on hit or block by pressing them in sequence.
    - Light attacks can chain into any strength, and heavy attacks into dust attacks.
    - Example chain: light-light-heavy-crouching dust or 5L-5L-5H-2D
### Defense
- Hold a direction away from your opponent to block attacks. Depending on whether you are crouching or not, you guard against different attacks.
- **Mid** attacks can be blocked crouching or standing, and are most common
- **Low** attacks can only be blocked crouching, and are the next most common
- **High** or **Overhead** attacks can only be blocked standing, and are the least most common and the easiest to react to: often your opponent will need to jump first.
- Blocking prevents getting comboed, as well as greatly reducing damage taken.
- Throws such as 6D and 4D and their air versions are unblockable: however, ground throws whiff against airborne opponents and vice versa.
```Tip:You can block in the air, and doing so blocks all types of attacks. Just watch out for increased pushback.```

## Special Moves
### Overview
- Special moves are moves inputted by a sequence of directions and buttons.
- All normal attacks are "cancellable" after hitting the opponent into a special attack.
- In combination with gatling combos, allows for large damage



## Advanced Offense
- Jump cancels: Air attacks and grounded light and dust attacks can be cancelled into a jump or double jump on hit.
- Wall/Ground bounces: Bouncing the opponent off of walls and floors grants extended hitstun the first 2 bounces. Use this to extend combos.
## Advanced Defense
- Blockstrings: Due to how gatling combos, jump cancels, and special cancels work, you might sometimes be in what is known as a "blockstring": a repeated series of blocked hits with little to no escape window.
- To escape: The gatling combo system isn't infallible. Eventually your opponent will be unable to continue the blockstring without a gap. In this gap, use your fastest or most disjointed buttons to escape, like 5L and 6L.


## Tension Meter
Below your character is the tension meter.
### Building Meter
You build meter by playing offensively: even simple things like approaching your opponent or jumping forwards grant meter. The best way to build meter though is attacking the opponent.
### Spending Meter
All uses of the Tension Meter cost **50%** of it.
#### Offense
- **Overdrive move**: attack which can be cancelled into from anything, and does a large amount of damage.
- **Roman Cancel**: Press Light+Heavy after hitting a move to cancel it, allowing you to continue your combo.
- **Gold Burst**: Press Heavy+Dust to use a Gold Burst which hits around you: if not blocked, gain full tension. Is **unconnectable**: i.e. cannot be performed against an opponent in hitstun.
```Tip:Overdrive attacks generally deal more damage than the combo you could get from a Roman Cancel, but Roman Cancels are more versatile.```
#### Defense
- **Psych Burst**: Press Heavy+Dust while in hitstun or blockstun to use a Psych Burst, escaping the combo or blockstring you are in.
```Tip:Psych Burst has very little blockstun and a reasonably long recovery time. As an attacker, you can try to "bait" the opponent into using their burst, then blocking it and continuing your combo.```
